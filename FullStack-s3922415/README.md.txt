Dear Professor,
I have a problem with the git organization: rmit-fsd-2025-s1. I cannot create a repo in this organization. I am wondering if it closed before my extension requests. My extension request is for Thursday (04/17/2025), but it seems to be closed on Sunday (04/13/2025). The only thing I can do is create a new repo in my account and make it public. Please, can you reconsider it?
Thank you so much,
Nguyen - s3922415
